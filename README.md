# Weight Progress Tracker Script

This repository contains the script.js file for the Weight Loss Progress Tracker application. The script.js file is responsible for handling the form submission and updating the line chart to track weight loss progress over time.

## Usage

The script.js file is designed to work with the index.html file and the styles.css file to create a simple weight loss progress tracker application. The script listens for form submissions and extracts weight and date inputs from the form. It then updates the line chart with the new data to visualize the weight loss progress over time.

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Include the script.js file in the same directory as the calculate.html file.

2. Make sure the calculate.html file contains the required form elements and the chart canvas with an id of "progressChart".

3. Ensure the calculate.css file is properly linked to the index.html file to apply the necessary styling to the application.

4. Open the calculate.html file in your web browser to use the Weight Loss Progress Tracker application.
